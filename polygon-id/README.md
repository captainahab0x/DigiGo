# DigiGo - One Reward to Rule them All

Tech: Polygon ID, PushProtocol, Safe (account abstraction on chain), provide a better UX, hacker has their own MetaMask, we have safe for MetaMask for customer, for the restaurant we cannot manage by team. Seamless sign in for customer and thus have better user experience. 
Restaurant multi sig and thus have better handling of payments. Core(account abstraction on safe) PolygonID, Ethereum Foundation only for account abstraction.

- implementing AA will certainly improve and scale the much-needed user experience around self-custody
- Identity onchain this is how restaurant connect with customers, if someone already has PolygonID than this person has access to this
- account abstraction with Safe which brings better UX and higher security, Push protocol to communicate and notification, restaurant gets payments to the identity wallet, ENS and Lens would second step if we use lens, we have profile picture of the customer and provide more benefit and take
- next step if we do NFT reward we cane use IPFS for file storage

bounty track
- PolygonID
- Safe
- ENS

implementation:
*(NFT as a reward ERC721)
- AA reduce the number of account types, or entities with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions.
- at a very high level, account abstraction allows us to make authorizations programmable, enabling a greater diversity of wallet and protocol design with   use cases including:


Challenges:
- account abstraction implementation is a challenging task because it requires multiple changes 
- account abstraction is complex, a lot of questions and investigations, 
- Integrating AA with notification/chat of push, zkproof credential, on-chain identity and zKproof, account with PolygonId --> currently no one has implemented this so far.

Future Plan:
- Brands can attach any kind of reward or experience to an NFT
- Loyalty and rewards play a major role the future of customer loyalty program
- NFTs have great potential to change the way people shop and engage with their favourite brands in the future
- Use of The Graph to query data containing information about who returned the
