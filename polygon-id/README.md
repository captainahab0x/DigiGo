Implementation:

AA reduce the number of account types, or entities with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions.
At a very high level, account abstraction allows us to make authorizations programmable, enabling a greater diversity of wallet and protocol design with use cases including:


Challenges:
- Account abstraction implementation is a challenging task because it requires multiple changes 
- Better use ERC20
- Account abstraction is complex, a lot of questions and investigations, 
- Implementing AA will certainly improve and scale the much-needed user experience around self-custody

NFTs are unique and exclusive
Brands can attach any kind of reward or experience to an NFT
Loyalty and rewards play a major role the future of customer loyalty program
NFTs have great potential to change the way people shop and engage with their favourite brands in the future
